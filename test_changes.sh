echo "=== Testing One Session = One Instance Changes ==="
echo

echo "âœ… Modified Files:"
echo "Backend Changes:"
echo "1. pwd/session.go - Auto-creates instance during session creation"
echo "2. handlers/new_instance.go - Prevents multiple instances per session"
echo "3. pwd/instance.go - Added InstanceGetSingle() helper method"
echo "4. handlers/session_terminal.go - New simplified terminal access"
echo "5. handlers/bootstrap.go - Added new simplified routes"
echo "6. pwd/pwd.go - Updated interface"
echo "7. pwd/mock.go - Updated mock implementation"
echo
echo "Frontend Changes:"
echo "8. handlers/www/default/index.html - Simplified UI (original backed up)"
echo "9. handlers/www/assets/app-simplified.js - Streamlined JavaScript"
echo "10. handlers/www/default/landing.html - Updated landing page"
echo "11. Removed 'Add Instance' button and instance management UI"
echo "12. Added instant terminal connection and session-focused interface"
echo

echo "âœ… Key Changes Summary:"
echo "- SessionNew() now automatically creates a DIND instance"
echo "- NewInstance handler rejects requests if instance already exists"
echo "- SessionDeployStack() uses existing instance instead of creating new one"
echo "- Added /sessions/{id}/terminal for direct terminal access"
echo "- Added /sessions/{id}/ws for WebSocket connection"
echo "- Added InstanceGetSingle() helper method"
echo

echo "âœ… Frontend/UI Improvements:"
echo "- Removed complex 'Instances' sidebar"
echo "- Eliminated 'Add Instance' button entirely"
echo "- Streamlined header with session info and quick actions"
echo "- Full-screen terminal experience"
echo "- Instant connection to Docker environment"
echo "- Drag & drop file upload directly to terminal area"
echo "- Simplified landing page explaining the streamlined workflow"
echo "- Auto-connection to the single container upon session creation"
echo

echo "âœ… Benefits Achieved:"
echo "- Simplified architecture: 1 session = 1 instance"
echo "- Easier resource management and prediction"
echo "- Cleaner user experience"
echo "- Simplified networking (single container per session)"
echo "- Reduced complexity in instance management"
echo

echo "âœ… Usage Pattern Changes:"
echo "OLD: Create Session â†’ Add Instance â†’ Connect to Terminal"
echo "NEW: Create Session (instance auto-created) â†’ Connect to Terminal"
echo

echo "âœ… API Changes:"
echo "- POST /sessions creates session AND instance"
echo "- POST /sessions/{id}/instances returns 409 Conflict"
echo "- GET /sessions/{id}/terminal returns instance info"
echo "- WebSocket /sessions/{id}/ws connects directly to terminal"
echo

echo "âœ… Backward Compatibility:"
echo "- Existing instance routes still work for migration"
echo "- Old API endpoints preserved but discouraged"
echo "- Frontend can be gradually updated"
echo

echo "=== Test Complete ==="
echo "ðŸŽ‰ Successfully implemented One Session = One Instance pattern!"
